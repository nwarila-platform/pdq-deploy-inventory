    .SYNOPSIS
        Reads Add/Remove Programs for one product and reports every matching
        registration, without changing anything.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Answers "is this installed, and at what version" from the authoritative
        Windows source. Add/Remove Programs carries the version and the install
        location together and Windows removes the entry on uninstall, so it can
        answer the question a vendor product key cannot: the vendor key survives
        uninstall with no install-path value.

        Org scripts are a single straightforward process stage in the org script
        template's architecture: one [ Script ] region carrying
        [ Initialization ] (strict mode, transport detection, input
        normalization), [ Main ] (read -> build ONE result object), and
        [ Output ] (the same object to $Ansible or as JSON).

        This script only ever reads, so its verdict is always NoChange.

        Two registrations of one product cannot both own the install, and
        choosing between them would be a guess, so the script refuses to answer
        instead: it reports ambiguous, fails under the Ansible transport, and
        exits 2 standalone. Refusing here rather than in each caller means every
        consumer inherits the same answer. The evidence is published either way,
        so a failure does not hide what it saw.

        Each entry is the whole uninstall registration, minus PowerShell's own
        PS* path bookkeeping, so one read answers publisher, install date,
        estimated size and anything else a caller needs without growing a field
        per question. Only the uninstall roots are read -- never a vendor's
        product tree, which is where secret material such as a licence key
        lives.

        An MSI product also reports product_id, the ProductCode -- taken from the uninstall
        SUBKEY NAME per Windows Installer's own contract, never reverse-parsed from a mutable
        uninstall string -- which win_package needs to remove it; empty for a non-MSI product.

        The uninstall roots are not a parameter. Where Windows registers
        installed software is a property of Windows, not a caller's choice, and
        there is no correct second setting to offer.

        Shipped by the org three-file convention: developed under scripts/ with
        its sibling Get-InstalledSoftware.pester.ps1 spec, while the pdq_deploy
        role carries files/Get-InstalledSoftware.ps1.stub, which the build
        resolves by dropping this file into the role.

    .PARAMETER DisplayName
        Exact Add/Remove Programs display name to match. Compared with -eq, so
        the match is exact and case-insensitive; a substring match would collect
        unrelated products that merely share a prefix.

    .PARAMETER Version
        The pinned version the caller intends to have installed. The script
        compares it against what is registered and reports action_required, so
        the comparison is made once, under test, instead of in each caller's
        template expressions.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> ./Get-InstalledSoftware.ps1 -DisplayName 'PDQ Deploy' -Version '20.1.8.0'
